          <h4>Understanding WHS Signage</h4>
          <p>Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) signage is critical in a workshop. These signs use specific colours and shapes to alert you to hazards:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Indicates danger or prohibition (e.g. no entry zones).</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Warns of potential hazards such as slippery surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Provides information and instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Denotes the location of safety equipment and emergency exits.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <!-- Additional Resource -->
          <h4>Additional Resource: Workplace Safety Signs</h4>
          <p>For further information on the safety signs you may encounter in a workplace, please visit the following webpage:</p>
          <p><a href="https://skillstrainingcollege.com.au/guide-to-health-and-safety-signs-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank">Guide To Health And Safety Signs In The Workplace</a></p>
          <p>This resource explains the different categories of WHS signs as per Australian standards and provides visual examples and usage guidelines.</p>
          
          <!-- Discussion Questions -->
          <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Why do you think WHS signs are essential in the workplace?</li>
            <li>Can you identify the differences between prohibition, mandatory, and warning signs? Give examples from the resource.</li>
            <li>How do the colours and symbols used in these signs help to communicate safety messages?</li>
            <li>Discuss how the information on the webpage can be applied to ensure safety in a timber workshop.</li>
            <li>What challenges might arise in ensuring that safety signs are visible and effective in a busy work environment?</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Tools</h4>
          <p>This week, you will be introduced to essential PPE and marking and measuring tools. Proper use of these items is critical for achieving precision and ensuring safety in all tasks.</p>
          
          <h4>The Importance of a Safety-First Mindset</h4>
          <p>Developing a safety-first mindset is crucial. A secure, organised workshop allows you to focus on learning and refining your skills without compromising your wellbeing, while also contributing to the overall quality and durability of your projects.</p>
          
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>By understanding WHS signage, exploring additional resources on safety signs, and engaging with the discussion questions, you lay a solid foundation for the Breadboard unit. This knowledge will serve you well as you progress through more complex tasks in the coming weeks.</p>
